# Athletics Attendance System

## Overview
The **Athletics Attendance System** is a simple web-based application designed to manage attendance efficiently for athletics sessions. The project prioritizes core functionality over design and ensures a strict authentication and attendance marking process.

## Features
1. **Admin Privileges**:
   - Admins are manually set in the database and cannot be modified by others.
   - No user other than the project owner has write permissions to the admin collection.
   
2. **Attendance Management**:
   - Admins can start and stop attendance sessions.
   - If an admin starts attendance within **2 hours of a previous session**, the previous session will be reactivated instead of creating a new one.
   - Admins can view the **total number of attendees** for all sessions on a selected day from the frontend.
   
3. **User Attendance Restrictions**:
   - Users **cannot mark attendance twice** for the same session.
   - Geolocation **must be enabled** for both admins and users.
   - Users **must be within 100m** of the admin to mark their attendance.
   - Users can **view** their total number of attendances till then.
   - Only users with an **IITR email** can log in.

5. **Hosting & Simplicity**:
   - The project focuses solely on attendance tracking without additional UI/UX elements.
   - Hosted on **Firebase** at: [Athletics Attendance](https://athletics-attendance.web.app/)

## Future Enhancements
In future updates, we plan to:
- Improve the website's design and usability.
- Introduce a **leave application** feature where users can upload proof of other priority tasks.
- Expand attendance tracking to **other sports** beyond athletics.
